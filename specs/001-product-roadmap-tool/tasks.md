# Tasks: Product Roadmap Creation Tool

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-product-roadmap-tool/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the specification, so test tasks are excluded. Focus on implementation tasks only.

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Based on plan.md, this is a Next.js 14+ App Router web application with the following structure:
- Frontend: `app/` (Next.js App Router pages and components)
- Components: `components/` (shared UI components)
- Backend: `app/api/` (API routes)
- Library code: `lib/` (utilities, hooks, stores, database)
- Database: `prisma/` (Prisma schema and migrations)
- Tests: `tests/` (unit, integration, e2e)
- Documentation: `docs/` (architecture documentation)

### Security Hardening

- [ ] T210 [P] Sanitize all user inputs before storage: XSS prevention in descriptions
- [ ] T211 [P] Validate all JSONB structures (yAxisValues, metadataLinks) before saving
- [ ] T212 [P] Ensure passwordHash is never returned in API responses: exclude in Prisma selects
- [ ] T213 Add rate limiting to login endpoint to prevent brute force attacks
- [ ] T214 Add CSRF protection to all mutation endpoints (built into Next.js, verify configuration)

### Production Readiness

- [ ] T215 [P] Configure production environment variables in .env.production template
- [ ] T216 [P] Setup database connection pooler configuration: PgBouncer or Prisma Accelerate
- [ ] T217 [P] Configure CORS for production API if separate frontend domain
- [ ] T218 Test production build with `npm run build` and `npm run start`
- [ ] T219 Verify all environment variables are documented in .env.example

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1: Setup**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Phase 2: Foundational**: Depends on Phase 1 completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **Phase 3: User Story 1 (P1)**: Depends on Phase 2 completion - No dependencies on other stories
- **Phase 4: User Story 5 (P2)**: Depends on Phase 2 completion - No dependencies on other stories (implemented early because auth is foundational)
- **Phase 5: User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on Phase 2, Phase 3 (US1 for UI), Phase 4 (US5 for write-lock) - Can start after US1 and US5
- **Phase 6: User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on Phase 2, Phase 3 (US1 for UI), Phase 4 (US5 for write-lock) - Can start after US1 and US5
- **Phase 7: User Story 4 (P3)**: Depends on Phase 2, Phase 3 (US1 for UI), Phase 4 (US5 for write-lock) - Can start after US1 and US5
- **Phase 8: User Story 6 (P3)**: Depends on Phase 2, Phase 3 (US1 for UI), Phase 4 (US5 for permissions) - Can start after US1 and US5
- **Phase 9: User Story 7 (P4)**: Depends on Phase 2, Phase 3 (US1 for UI) - Can start after US1, minimal implementation
- **Phase 10: Polish**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

```

    ‚Üì
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí US1: View Roadmap (Phase 3) ‚Üê MVP Foundation
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí US5: Auth & Access Control (Phase 4) ‚Üê Parallel with US1

```

### Within Each User Story

- API routes can run in parallel (marked [P])
- Hooks can run in parallel (marked [P])
- UI components can run in parallel (marked [P])
- Integration tasks depend on components being ready (not marked [P])
- Tests (if included) must be written and FAIL before implementation

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T002-T009 can all run in parallel (different config files)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- Database: T012-T017 are sequential (schema ‚Üí migration ‚Üí client)
- Auth: T018-T024 can run in parallel after T021 middleware is ready
- Utilities: T025-T033 can all run in parallel (different utility files)
- React Query: T034-T035 can run in parallel with utilities

**Phase 3 (US1)**:
- API routes: T036-T039 can all run in parallel
- Hooks: T040-T042 can all run in parallel
- Components: T043, T048, T051 can start in parallel, then integrate

**Phase 4 (US5)**:
- Login page: T064-T065 can run in parallel
- State: T068-T069 can run in parallel
- Permission UI: T071-T072 can run in parallel after T071 hook is ready
- Lock status: T075-T076 can run in parallel
- Admin API: T079-T081 can all run in parallel

**Phase 5 (US2)**:
- API routes: T084-T088 can run in parallel
- Lock hooks: T090-T091 can run in parallel
- Drag-drop: T097-T099 can run in parallel
- Network: T106 can run in parallel with other tasks

**User Story Parallelization**:
- After Phase 2, Phase 3 (US1) and Phase 4 (US5) can run in parallel by different developers
- After US1 and US5 complete, Phase 5-8 (US2, US3, US4, US6) can run in parallel by different team members
- US7 can run in parallel with any user story after US1

---

## Parallel Example: Foundation Phase

```bash
# Launch database setup:
Task: "Create Prisma schema with all entities in prisma/schema.prisma"

# While database is being designed, launch auth utilities in parallel:
Task: "Create mock user database in lib/auth/mock-users.ts"
Task: "Create JWT utilities in lib/auth/jwt.ts"
Task: "Create permission check utilities in lib/auth/check-permission.ts"

# And shared utilities in parallel:
Task: "Copy contracts/types.ts to lib/types/api.ts"
Task: "Create date validation utilities in lib/utils/date-validator.ts"
Task: "Create API response utilities in lib/utils/api-response.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (US1 + US5 Only)

This delivers a working roadmap viewer with authentication:

1. **Phase 1**: Setup (T001-T011) ‚Üí ~2-3 hours
2. **Phase 2**: Foundational (T012-T035) ‚Üí ~1-2 days
3. **Phase 3**: User Story 1 - View Roadmap (T036-T063) ‚Üí ~2-3 days
4. **Phase 4**: User Story 5 - Auth & Access Control (T064-T083) ‚Üí ~1-2 days

**Total MVP**: ~5-8 days for experienced developer

**MVP Deliverable**: Users can log in, view roadmaps with products displayed on 2D chart, switch axis modes, see their permissions

### Incremental Delivery

1. **MVP** (US1 + US5): View roadmaps with auth ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
2. **+ US2**: Add drag-and-drop editing ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (core functionality complete)
3. **+ US3**: Add product creation ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. **+ US4**: Add product editing/deletion ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (full CRUD complete)
5. **+ US6**: Add multiple roadmap management ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. **+ US7**: Add dashboard linking ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. **Polish**: Documentation, performance, accessibility ‚Üí Final release

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3 developers after Foundation is complete:

- **Developer A**: Phase 3 (US1) ‚Üí Phase 5 (US2) ‚Üí Phase 9 (US7)
- **Developer B**: Phase 4 (US5) ‚Üí Phase 6 (US3) ‚Üí Phase 8 (US6)
- **Developer C**: Phase 7 (US4) ‚Üí Phase 10 (Polish)

All work in parallel branches, integrate at checkpoints.

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 219
**By Phase**:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 11 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 24 tasks (CRITICAL PATH)
- Phase 3 (US1 - View): 28 tasks
- Phase 4 (US5 - Auth): 20 tasks
- Phase 5 (US2 - Drag-Drop): 31 tasks
- Phase 6 (US3 - Add Products): 15 tasks
- Phase 7 (US4 - Edit Products): 18 tasks
- Phase 8 (US6 - Multiple Roadmaps): 23 tasks
- Phase 9 (US7 - Dashboard Links): 14 tasks
- Phase 10 (Polish): 35 tasks

**Parallel Tasks**: 98 tasks marked [P] (45% can run in parallel)

**MVP Tasks** (US1 + US5): 83 tasks (T001-T083)

**Independent Stories**: Each user story phase is independently testable and deliverable

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within the phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Tests are NOT included as they were not requested in the specification
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- File paths follow Next.js 14+ App Router conventions from plan.md
