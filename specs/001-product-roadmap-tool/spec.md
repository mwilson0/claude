# Feature Specification: Product Roadmap Creation Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-product-roadmap-tool`
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a web application. The initial application is a roadmap creation tool for physical products. The roadmap should have a user specified time or phase on the x-axis and product category, investment area, or product type on the y-axis. The elements that represent the individual products on the roadmap should contain the product codename, the product part number, a description of the product, the sample date and release date of the product. The products on the roadmap should be drag-able to different locations within the chart to enable users to modify the roadmap priority. The products themselves will be linked by metadata to other dashboards, allowing users to navigate between dashboards and see data visualizations about related data. The hierarchy and network of dashboards is still under definition, so we need to create the roadmap dashboard/webapp as a standalone product and build out from there. The goal would be to focus on individual dashboards/webapps and link them through metadata once they're mature enough."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-28

- Q: How should the system handle invalid date sequences when sample date is after release date? → A: Prevent with clear error - System blocks saving/dragging until dates are corrected and shows specific validation message
- Q: How should the system handle unsaved changes when a write-lock expires during active editing? → A: Display confirmation dialog with three options: Save changes, Discard changes, or Extend session. Dialog has 60-second timeout; if no selection is made, changes are discarded and lock is released
- Q: How should the system resolve simultaneous edit requests from multiple users? → A: Race-condition handling with first-wins - System processes requests sequentially at backend; first request acquires lock, second receives immediate notification that lock is held
- Q: How should the system handle write-locks when the lock holder's session terminates unexpectedly? → A: Stale lock detection with timeout - System marks lock as stale after 2-3 minutes of no heartbeat and automatically releases it, notifying waiting users
- Q: How should the system handle network disconnections during active editing sessions? → A: Client-side buffer with retry - System buffers changes locally, attempts automatic reconnection for 60 seconds, then prompts user to save offline or discard

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Product Roadmap (Priority: P1)

A product manager opens the roadmap application to view their product portfolio organized by time/phase and category. They can see all products with their key information displayed on an interactive chart.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - viewing the roadmap. Without this, the application has no purpose. This delivers immediate value by providing visibility into product timelines and organization.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the application, configuring axis preferences (time/phase on x-axis, category/investment area/product type on y-axis), and verifying that products are displayed with all required information (codename, part number, description, sample date, release date).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has opened the roadmap application, **When** they select "Timeline" for x-axis and "Product Category" for y-axis, **Then** the roadmap displays products positioned by their dates along the timeline and grouped by their product category
2. **Given** the roadmap is displayed, **When** the user hovers over a product element, **Then** they can view the product codename, part number, description, sample date, and release date
3. **Given** a user wants to view by phases instead of time, **When** they switch the x-axis to "Phase" mode, **Then** the roadmap reorganizes to show products grouped by phase (e.g., Concept, Development, Launch, Production)
4. **Given** multiple products exist in the same time period and category, **When** the roadmap is displayed, **Then** products are arranged to avoid overlapping and remain readable

---

### User Story 2 - Reorganize Products via Drag-and-Drop (Priority: P2)

A product manager needs to adjust product priorities and timelines. They drag product elements to new positions on the roadmap to reflect updated schedules or strategic changes.

**Why this priority**: This enables the primary interactive functionality of roadmap management. While viewing is essential, the ability to modify the roadmap makes it a planning tool rather than just a visualization.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by displaying a roadmap with multiple products, dragging a product from one position to another (changing time/phase and/or category), and verifying the product's position is updated and persisted.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a product is displayed on the roadmap, **When** the user drags the product to a different time period on the x-axis, **Then** the product's sample and release dates are updated to reflect the new position
2. **Given** a product is displayed on the roadmap, **When** the user drags the product to a different category on the y-axis, **Then** the product's category/investment area is updated accordingly
3. **Given** a user has moved a product to a new position, **When** they release the drag, **Then** the product snaps to the nearest valid grid position and the change is saved
4. **Given** a user has made changes to the roadmap, **When** they refresh the page, **Then** all position changes are persisted and displayed correctly

---

### User Story 3 - Add New Products to Roadmap (Priority: P3)

A product manager needs to add a new product to the roadmap. They create a new product entry with all required information and place it on the roadmap.

**Why this priority**: While important for roadmap management, this can initially be handled through data import or backend configuration. The core value is viewing and reorganizing existing products.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking an "Add Product" action, entering product details (codename, part number, description, sample date, release date), selecting initial position (time/phase and category), and verifying the new product appears on the roadmap.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to add a new product, **When** they click "Add Product" and fill in the required fields, **Then** a new product element is created and placed on the roadmap
2. **Given** a user is creating a new product, **When** they leave required fields empty, **Then** the system prevents creation and indicates which fields are required
3. **Given** a new product is created, **When** the user specifies its sample and release dates, **Then** the product is automatically positioned on the correct time/phase location on the x-axis

---

### User Story 4 - Edit Product Information (Priority: P3)

A product manager needs to update product details such as dates, descriptions, or part numbers. They select a product and edit its information directly.

**Why this priority**: This enables data maintenance within the application. Similar to adding products, this could initially be handled through other means while focusing on the core visualization and interaction features.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting an existing product, modifying one or more fields (codename, part number, description, dates), saving changes, and verifying the updated information is displayed and persisted.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a product is displayed on the roadmap, **When** the user double-clicks or selects "Edit" on the product, **Then** an edit form appears with the current product information
2. **Given** the user is editing a product, **When** they change the sample or release dates, **Then** the product's position on the roadmap updates to reflect the new dates
3. **Given** the user has made changes to product information, **When** they save the changes, **Then** the updated information is displayed on the product element and persisted to the data store

---

### User Story 5 - User Authentication and Access Control (Priority: P2)

A user logs into the application with their credentials and gains access to roadmaps based on their assigned permissions. Viewers can only see roadmaps, while editors can modify them.

**Why this priority**: Authentication and access control are foundational for multi-user and multi-roadmap support. This must be in place before users can work with multiple roadmaps securely.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by attempting to log in with valid credentials, verifying access to authorized roadmaps, attempting to edit as a viewer (should be blocked), and editing as an editor (should succeed with write-lock).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has valid credentials, **When** they log in, **Then** they are authenticated and shown a list of roadmaps they have permission to access
2. **Given** a user has viewer permissions for a roadmap, **When** they open that roadmap, **Then** they can view all products but cannot drag, add, or edit them
3. **Given** a user has editor permissions for a roadmap, **When** they attempt to make changes, **Then** the system acquires a write-lock and enables editing functionality
4. **Given** a roadmap is write-locked by another user, **When** a second editor attempts to make changes, **Then** they receive a notification showing who holds the lock and are placed in read-only mode
5. **Given** an editor has held a write-lock and becomes inactive for 5 minutes, **When** another editor checks the roadmap, **Then** the lock is automatically released and available for the new editor

---

### User Story 6 - Manage Multiple Roadmaps (Priority: P3)

A user with access to multiple roadmaps needs to switch between them and understand which roadmap they are currently viewing. Admins can create new roadmaps and manage access permissions.

**Why this priority**: While important for organizational scalability, the core roadmap functionality should work first. Multiple roadmaps add organizational value but don't change the fundamental interaction model.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating multiple roadmaps with different names, assigning different products to each, switching between them, and verifying that the correct products are displayed for each roadmap.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has access to multiple roadmaps, **When** they log in, **Then** they see a list or dropdown of available roadmaps they can access
2. **Given** a user is viewing a roadmap, **When** they switch to a different roadmap from the list, **Then** the display updates to show the products and configuration of the selected roadmap
3. **Given** an admin user wants to create a new roadmap, **When** they use the "Create Roadmap" function, **Then** a new empty roadmap is created with a unique identifier and name
4. **Given** an admin is managing a roadmap, **When** they assign permissions to users, **Then** those users gain the specified access level (viewer, editor, admin) to that roadmap
5. **Given** a user attempts to access a roadmap they don't have permissions for, **When** they try to open it, **Then** they are denied access with an appropriate message

---

### User Story 7 - Navigate to Related Dashboards (Priority: P4)

A product manager viewing a product on the roadmap wants to see related data visualizations. They click on a product to navigate to associated dashboards that provide deeper insights.

**Why this priority**: This enables the future multi-dashboard ecosystem, but is deprioritized since the dashboard hierarchy is still under definition. The roadmap should function as a standalone tool first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking on a product element, viewing available related dashboard links, selecting a dashboard, and verifying navigation to the target dashboard with appropriate context/filters applied.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a product has associated dashboard links configured in its metadata, **When** the user clicks on the product, **Then** a menu displays available related dashboards
2. **Given** the user sees related dashboard options, **When** they select a dashboard, **Then** they are navigated to that dashboard with the selected product's context passed as parameters
3. **Given** a product has no associated dashboards, **When** the user clicks on the product, **Then** they see product details but no dashboard navigation options

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user drags a product to an invalid position (e.g., outside the defined time range or phase boundaries)?
- How does the system handle products with missing or invalid dates?
- What happens when too many products are placed in the same time period and category, causing visual overcrowding?
- How does the system handle concurrent edits when multiple users are modifying the same roadmap?
- What happens when a product's sample date is after its release date (invalid date sequence)? → System prevents saving/dragging and displays validation error requiring correction before proceeding
- How does the roadmap display products that span multiple phases or have flexible timelines?
- What happens when axis configuration is changed while products are being dragged?
- How does the system handle very long product names or descriptions that don't fit in the product element?
- What happens if a user's write-lock expires while they are actively dragging a product? → System displays a confirmation dialog with 60-second countdown offering three options: save changes, discard changes, or extend session; if timeout expires without selection, changes are discarded and lock is released
- How does the system handle network disconnections during edit operations? → System buffers changes locally and attempts automatic reconnection for 60 seconds; if reconnection fails, user is prompted to save changes offline or discard them
- What happens when an admin removes a user's permissions while they are actively viewing or editing a roadmap?
- How does the system handle attempting to delete a roadmap that is currently being viewed by other users?
- What happens when two users with editor permissions click edit at exactly the same time? → System processes requests sequentially at backend using first-wins approach; first user acquires write-lock, second user immediately receives notification that lock is held
- How does the system display lock status when the lock holder's session terminates unexpectedly (browser crash, network failure)? → System uses heartbeat mechanism to detect stale locks; after 2-3 minutes without heartbeat, lock is marked stale and automatically released with notification to waiting users

### Key Entities

- **Product**: Represents a physical product on the roadmap with attributes including codename (short identifier), part number (unique identifier), description (text explanation), sample date (when samples are available), release date (when product launches), current position (time/phase and category), and metadata links (references to related dashboards)

- **Roadmap Configuration**: Represents user preferences for how the roadmap is displayed, including x-axis mode (time or phase), y-axis grouping (product category, investment area, or product type), time range or phase set for x-axis, and category/investment/type values for y-axis

- **Dashboard Link**: Represents a connection between a product and related dashboards, including target dashboard identifier, link type or relationship description, and display label for navigation

- **User**: Represents an authenticated user with attributes including user credentials, assigned roles, and access permissions to specific roadmaps

- **Roadmap**: Represents an independent roadmap instance with attributes including unique identifier, name/title, associated products, configuration settings, and access control list defining which users/roles can view or edit

## Assumptions

- Users have basic familiarity with drag-and-drop interfaces
- Product data will be initially populated from an existing data source or manual entry
- The application will be accessed via modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest two versions)
- Time-based axis will support standard calendar date ranges (days, weeks, months, quarters, years)
- Phase-based axis will use a standard product development lifecycle (Concept, Development, Testing, Launch, Production) unless customized
- Y-axis groupings (categories, investment areas, product types) will be configurable but have a maximum of 10-15 distinct values to maintain readability
- Dashboard links will be stored as metadata but the target dashboards may not exist initially
- Data persistence will use standard web application storage mechanisms (database, API backend)
- The application will be deployed as a web application accessible via URL
- Desktop browsers will have minimum screen resolution of 1280x720 pixels (standard HD resolution)
- Authentication will use standard session-based or token-based authentication mechanisms
- Role-based access control will include at least three permission levels: Viewer (read-only), Editor (read/write), and Admin (full access including permission management)
- Write-lock timeout of 5 minutes of inactivity is sufficient to prevent indefinite lock situations
- Maximum of 2 concurrent viewers per roadmap is sufficient for typical use cases
- Each organization may have multiple roadmaps organized by product line, region, department, or other business criteria


## Notes

- This specification focuses on the standalone roadmap application as requested, with metadata support for future dashboard integration
- The drag-and-drop interaction is central to the user experience and should be intuitive and responsive
- The application should be designed with extensibility in mind to accommodate future dashboard linking without major refactoring
- Visual design and specific UI/UX patterns are intentionally left to the implementation phase, but must prioritize clarity and ease of use
